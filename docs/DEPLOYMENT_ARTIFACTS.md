## 4. Architecture Summary


### Key Design Patterns
- **WhatsApp-First**: All flows designed for mobile WebView inside WhatsApp
- **Context Injection**: Phone number passed via URL (`?phone=254...`)
- **BFF Pattern**: Server Actions proxy requests to backend API
- **Stateless**: No local database; all data from upstream API
- **Secure Tokens**: Auth tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies

---

## 5. API Endpoints Integrated

All API calls route through `process.env.API_URL/ussd`

| Endpoint | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| `lookup` | Customer/PIN verification |
| `submit_invoice` | Create sales invoice |
| `credit_note` | Submit credit notes |
| `fetch_invoices` | Retrieve buyer-initiated invoices |
| `process_buyer_invoice` | Accept/reject buyer invoices |
| `check_user_status` | Verify eTIMS registration |
| `register_taxpayer` | Register for eTIMS service |
| `generate_otp` / `verify_otp` | Authentication |

### Request Headers
```
Authorization: Bearer <etims_auth_token>
x-source-for: whatsapp
Content-Type: application/json
```

## 6. WhatsApp Integration

### Notification Types

| Type | Trigger | Purpose |
|:-----|:--------|:--------|
| `etims_invoice` | Sales invoice created | Send Invoice PDF to seller/buyer |
| `etims_credit_note` | Credit note submitted | Send Credit Note PDF |
| `etims_buyer_pending` | Buyer invoice created | Notify buyer for approval |
| `etims_buyer_action` | Buyer accepts/rejects | Notify seller of decision |

### WhatsApp API Configuration
- Uses Meta WhatsApp Business Cloud API
- Sends PDFs as document attachments
- Sends text notifications for status updates

## 7. Application Routes

| Route | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `/` | Main services dashboard |
| `/etims` | eTIMS invoicing module |
| `/etims/auth/*` | Authentication (login, OTP) |
| `/etims/sales-invoice/*` | Sales invoice wizard |
| `/etims/credit-note/*` | Credit note flow |
| `/etims/buyer-initiated/*` | Buyer/Seller invoice flow |

---

## 8. Security Considerations

- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Auth tokens stored securely, not accessible to JavaScript
- **Server-Side Secrets**: API keys never exposed to client
- **VAT Restriction**: Hard block prevents VAT-registered taxpayers from using service
- **Token Injection**: All API requests authenticated server-side

---

## 9. Testing Resources

Test scripts available in `/scripts/`:

| Script | Purpose |
|:-------|:--------|
| `test_etims_curl.sh` | eTIMS API endpoint testing |
| `test_fetch_invoices.sh` | Invoice retrieval tests |
